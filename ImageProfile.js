// React component functions must start with a capital letter or they WON'T work!
// if your markup isnâ€™t all on the same line as the `return` keyword, you must wrap it in a pair of parentheses
// Without parentheses, any code on the lines after return will be IGNORED
// if it's in the same line as `return`, just use a semi-colon at the end
